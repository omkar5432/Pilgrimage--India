At a distance of 30 km from Okha, 105 km from Porbandar, 130 km from Jamnagar, 208 km from Junagadh, 224 km from Rajkot, 233 km from Somnath, 294 km from Amreli, 344 km from Gandhidham, 388 km from Bhuj, 442 km from Ahmedabad, and 512 km from Vadodara, Dwarka is an ancient city situated on the banks of Gomti River in the northwestern Indian state of Gujarat. Dwarka is one of the most significant Hindu places of pilgrimage in India, and among the must include places in Gujarat tour packages.<br><br>
Located on the western tip of the Saurashtra peninsula in Gujarat, Dwarka is popularly known as the 'home of Lord Krishna' and is believed to have been the first capital of Gujarat. 
Also, Dwarka is one of the foremost Char Dhams for Hindus and among the seven most ancient religious cities (sapta puris) in India. The literal meaning of Dwarka is the 'gateway to heaven' in Sanskrit, as Dwar means gate and ka refers to Lord Brahma. 
For this reason, the town attracts thousands of pilgrims throughout the year as part of Dwarka tour packages.<br><br>
Earlier called Mokshapuri, Kusahasthali, and Dwarkavati, Dwarka has been mentioned in the ancient epic Mahabharata. 
According to legend, the town is described as the capital of Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna killed cruel king Kansa at Mathura. To avenge Kansa's death Jarasandh, the father-in-law of Kansa, attacked Krishna's kingdom 17 times and to avoid further clashes, Lord Krishna shifted his capital from Mathura to Dwarka, a city specifically created by Vishwakarma, the Hindu god of architecture on 12 yojanas (96 sq. km) of land that was blessed by the sea god.<br><br>
It is believed that the city of Dwarka was submerged by the ocean after the death of Krishna. It is said that the city was rebuilt six times and the present city is the seventh one. There are also some archaeological signs to support the belief that the ancient Dwarka lies buried under the present Dwarka and extended up to Beyt Dwarka in the north, Okhamadhi in the south, and Pindara in the east. 
The recent underwater study on the coastal water of Dwarka by the ASI reveals the existence of a city dating to the 2nd millennium BC. The search for the lost city was going on since the 1930s. The excavation work carried between 1983 and 1990 revealed that a township was built in six sectors. A fortified wall, extending more than half a mile has also been unearthed.<br><br>

Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple is an ancient Hindu temple in the town of Trimbak, in the Trimbakeshwar tehsil in the Nashik District of Maharashtra, India, 28 km from the city of Nashik and 40 km from Nashik road. It is dedicated to Hindu god Shiva and is one of the twelve jyotirlingas where the Hindu genealogy registers at Trimbakeshwar, Maharashtra are kept. The origin of the sacred Godavari river is near Trimbak.
Kusavarta kunda (sacred pond) in the temple premises, built by Shrimant Sardar Raosaheb Parnerkar who was the Fadnavis of Indore State, is the source of the Godavari River, the second longest river in peninsular India. A bust of Sardar Fadnavis and his wife can be seen on the edge of the kunda. The current temple was built by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao after it was destroyed by Mughal ruler Aurangzeb.<br><br>
The temple is located between three hills namely Brahmagiri, Nilagiri and Kalagiri. The temple has three lingas (an iconic form of Shiv) representing Shiv, Vishnu and Brahma. The temple tank is called Amritavarshini, which measured 28 m (92 ft) by 30 m (98 ft). There are three other bodies of water, namely, Bilvatirtha, Viswanantirtha and Mukundatirtha. There are images of various deities, namely, Gangadevi, Jaleswara, Rameswara, Gautameswara, Kedarnatha, Rama, Krishna, Parasurama and Lakshmi Narayana. 
The temple has also several monasteries and samadhis of saints.<br><br>
Trimbakeshwar is a religious center having one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The extraordinary feature of the Jyotirlinga located here is its three faces embodying Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Rudra. Due to the excessive use of water, the linga has started to erode. It is said that this erosion symbolizes the eroding nature of human society. The Lingas are covered by a jeweled crown which is placed over the Gold Mask of Tridev (Brahma Vishnu Mahesh). 
The crown is said to be from the age of Pandavs and consists of diamonds, emeralds, and many precious stones. The crown is displayed every Monday from 4-5 pm (Shiv).<br><br>
All other Jyotirlingas have Shiva as the main deity. The entire black stone temple is known for its appealing architecture and sculpture and is at the foothills of a mountain called Brahmagiri. Three sources of the Godavari originate from the Brahmagiri mountain.<br><br>

At a distance of 24 km from Ratnagiri, 152 km from Kolhapur, 193 km from Mahabaleshwar, 207 km from Satara, 291 km from Lonavala, 307 km from Pune, and 345 km from Mumbai, Ganpatipule is a small pilgrimage & beach town located in the Ratnagiri district on the Konkan coast of Maharashtra in India. 
This is one of the top places to visit in Maharashtra and also one of the best places to visit near Pune.<br><br>
The town is mainly known for its 400 years old temple of Lord Ganapati which is the prime attraction in Ganpatipule tour packages. The idol of Ganesha is believed to be a monolith that was self-incarnated and discovered over 1600 years ago. The Ganesha Temple in Ganpatipule is unique because it is one of the few temples in the country in which the presiding deity faces west. 
Known as 'Paschim Dwar Devata', it is one of the Ashta Ganapati Temples of India and among the prominent places of pilgrimage in Maharashtra. The temple is at the base of a hill, and pilgrims walk around (pradakshina) the hill as a mark of respect.<br><br>
There are two legends associated with the name of Ganpatipule town. According to one legend, after being insulted by a local lady, Lord Ganapati moved to Pule from his original abode of Gule. Thus the region was named Ganpati-Pule. According to another belief, the town got its name from the white sand (or Pule in Marathi) from which the idol of Ganesha was formed. Ganpatipule can be visited along with Mahabaleshwar as part of Mahabaleshwar packages.

Vrindavan is considered to be a sacred place for Vaisnavism tradition of Hinduism. The other prominent areas surrounding Vrindavan are Govardhana, Gokul, Nandgaon, Barsana, Mathura and Bhandirvan. Along with Vrindavan, all these places are considered to be the center of Radha and Krishna worship. 
Millions of devotees of Radha Krishna visit Vrindavan and its nearby areas every year to participate in number of festivals. The common salutation or greetings used in Braj region by its residents is Radhe Radhe which is associated with the Goddess Radha or Hare Krishna which is associated with Krishna.<br><br>
Imbued with elegance and grandeur, the Prem Mandir is a massive temple that was shaped by Jagadguru Shri Kripaluji Maharaj in the year 2001. Known as "Temple of God's love", this grand religious place is dedicated to Radha Krishna as well as Sita Ram. Located in Vrindavan, the holy city in the district of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, the temple is enveloped with piousness and serenity. This newly constructed temple is the most beautiful in the entire Brij area and is crowded with devotees during the time of the Aarti.<br><br>
Made out of white marble and adorned with very intricate carvings, this temple is also famous for its architectural beauty. Statues of Shri Krishna and his admirers, portraying essential occasions surrounding the Lord's life, cover the main temple. Various scenes from Krishna's life, like raising the Govardhan Mountain, have been depicted on the periphery of the Prem Mandir. The lighting of the temple further glorifies its spectacular look, especially during the night. The colored water twists and twirls to the tunes of the kirtans of Radha Krishna being played nearby and are an audio-visual delight.<br><br>
